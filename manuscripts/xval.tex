\section*{Cross validation: Bluefin Case Study}

\begin{itemize}
 \item The aim of the paper is use prediction residuals to evaluate model misspecification, over parameterisation and prediction skill.
 \item Two procedures are used
  \begin{description}
    \item{Leave-one-out} to calculate the prediction residuals and then compare these to the model residuals; if the prediction residuals are much greater than the model residuals then the model is overfitted. 
    \item{Hindcast, or step 1,2,3 ahead predictions} to compare prediction skill using the Mean Absolute Scaled Error.
  \end{description}
 \item The models and datasets used are those form the 2017 East Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin stock assessment. 
 \item Three stock assessment models with different treatments of process and measurement error are considered, namely Stock Synthesis, SAM and VPA.
 \item The Stock Synthesis analysis is based on two runs, one with 160 and another with 90 estimated parameters.   
 \item The two Stock Synthesis runs are then reconfigured as an Age Structured Production Model by fixing the selection pattern parameter in order to evaluate wether dynamics are driven by a production function or recruitments

\section*{Parsimonious OM Grid}

\begin{itemize}
 \item When conducting Management Strategy Evaluation using an Operating Model conditioned on a stock assessment often a full factorial design is used based on scenarios reflecting uncertainty in difficult to estimate parameters, data weights and model specification. 
 \item The aim of this paper is to evaluate the use of more parsimonious designs using the OM grids developed for Atlantic bluefin tuna, North Atlantic and Indian Oceans albacore and swordfish. 
 \item The Operating Models are grouped into clusters based on their i) production functions and ii) time series
 \item If the performance of a MP depends on i) production functions or ii) time series then it is only neccessary to run a limited number of OM from each cluster. 
 \item This hypothesis is tested by performing a cross validation where an OM is selected from each cluster and a MSE conducted. This is then repeated for another set of OMs by cluster and the performance of the MPs compared.

\section*{Short and Long Term Prediction Skill}


\begin{itemize}
 \item Use cross validation to evaluate overfitting and hindcasting to evaluate prediction skill for emprical and model based Management Procedures and Operating Models conditioned using a stock assessment paradigm.
 \item When conducting Management Strategy Evaluation the stock assessment in the Management Procedure is intended to provide advice in the short term, while the Operating Model is designed to characterise uncertainty in the long term. In the former case there is requirement for good short term prediction skill and in the later case, when conditioning an Operating Model using a stock assessment paradigm,  good long term prediction skill. 
 \item Of particular concern when conditioining an Operating Model is that the past may not represent the future. To date two ways have been used to deal with this: either expand the level of uncertainty moving forwards compared to the past, or to invoke Exceptional Circumstances and revise the Management Procedure if future data turn out to be outside the range considered in the trials upon which the Management Procedure had been selected. In the former if quotas are set based on risk then this will result in a reduction in yield while in the later there is a danger of invoking Exceptional Circumstances when the Management Procedure produces an unpalatable result and also negating one of the reasons for conducting Management Strategy Evaluation which is to reduce the frequency of stock assessments.   
 \item Poor prediction skill can result from overfitting where the model is able to describe the past but has poor ability in forecasting. Therefore a more rigorous way is to perform cross validation to test the prediction skill of a model using a set of data not used when fitting. There is often insufficient data, however, in stock assessment datasets to allow some of it to be kept back for testing. A more sophisticated way to create test datasets is, like the jackknife, to leave out one (or more) observation at a time. Cross validation then allows prediction residuals to be calculated, i.e. the difference between fitted and predicted values where the later is calculated from the out-of-sample predictions. A comparison of the variance of the model and prediction residuals can be used to identify over fitting.
 %\item In the long term prediction skill depends on knowledge about productivity and recruitment, while in the short term prediction skill depends on how acurately current status, reference points and recent year-classes are estimated.
 \item Prediction skill in the future can be evaluated by use of a hindcast where a model is fitted to the first part of a time series and then projected over the period omitted in the original fit. Prediction skill is then evaluated by comparing the projections ($\hat{Y}_t$) with observations ($Y_t$) at time $t$ for a given horizon ($h$) using the Mean Absolute Scaled Error\\  
$MASE={\frac {\sum _{t=1}^{T} \left|Y_t-\hat{Y}_t \right|}{{\frac {T}{T-h}}\sum _{t=h}^{T}\left|Y_{t}-Y_{t-h}\right|}}$ 
\end{itemize}


 \item A variety of approaches have been used for short term forecasting, methods include Support Vector Regression (SVR), an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS).
